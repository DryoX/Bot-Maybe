# HOW TO HOST THE BOT?

  You can use HEROKU!
  
  I recomended to push this bot using HEROKU CLI!
  
  Do not use github as your main push!
  its to danger to let your bot token laying around at github!
  it can be stolen and used on another program that will make your bot to spamming mention
  on all over your server!
  
  and using bot.login(process.env.BOT_TOKEN); wont work!
  
  trust me! i've try it! multiple times!
